# Numerical validations 
This directory contains scripts that compare the tiny filter models to numerical simulations using the MaxwellFDFD MATLAB toolbox (See  https://github.com/wsshin/maxwellfdfd).
The numerical data is precomputed and is loaded from the generated .MAT files.

# 2D 
## Diffractive model 

The diffractive wave optics model is based on square aperture diffraction. It is used for predicting the transmittance of filters in a filter array.
This validation looks at three adjacent filters.
