function  kernel = pixel_default(width)
%  PIXEL_FULLWIDTH  Returns the default kernel for a pixel size equal to filter size as an anonymous function which can be evaluated at any spatial frequency.
%
%  Inputs:    
%   - width: width of the pixel (use units consistent with other distances)
%  
%  Outputs:
%    kernel: anonymous function which can be evaluated as kernel(nu)
%
